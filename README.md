#Python Web App
This class project for CS340 (Intro to Computer Systems) is a Python Web App that takes a class code as input (e.g. CS 225) and returns real-time weather data for that class's next meeting in degrees fahrenheit. Also displays weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, partly cloudy, snowing, etc.). Weather data is pulled from the National Web Service API, with API requests being contained throught GET and POST endpoints. This weather app is limited to forecasts within the Urbana-Champaign area.

The frontend of the webpage can be found in index.html, and the backend/weather data logic is found in classweather.py.
